# Columbia University Coding Bootcamp - 02 Advanced CSS Challenge 2: Portfolio

## Description

This project is the first iteration of my creative working portfolio. This iteration presents a basic structure to host a landing page, an 'about' page, a 'work' page with placeholders for future linked applications, and a 'contact' page. The user interface adapts to the user's device, or rather, their screen's width dimension. For reference, I have attached images of the landing page at 3 different screen width ranges:

### Desktop
![home page desktop scale](./README-images/home-desktop.png)

### Tablet
![home page tablet scale](./README-images/home-tablet.png)

### Mobile
![home page mobile scale](./README-images/home-mobile.png)

    * Note: I present two versions of navigation (the first is commented out)
